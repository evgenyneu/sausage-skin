I roll up, phonk beats, got the city vibin' right
Dark shades in the night, yeah, we living out of sight
Haters stay talkin', but my crew, we ignite
Catch us ridin' by, in that neon light
Bass bumpin', windows down, feel the vibe
Chillin' with the homies, always on a wild ride
Throwin' down rhymes, in the urban jungle ground
We set the stage on fire, breakin' ceilings, breakin' bounds

Phonk in the beat, gotta let it roll
City lights shine, we lose control
Bass hits hard, feel it in your soul
Ridin' with the phonk, watch us steal the showh
