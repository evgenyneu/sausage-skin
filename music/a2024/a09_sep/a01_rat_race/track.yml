  Lyrics:

  Stuck on the hedonic wheel, running in place,
  Chasing the next high, but it’s a rat race.
  Consumerism got us, buying shit we don’t need,
  Feeding the machine, while our souls bleed.
  Drowning in ads, they sell me lies,
  Telling me happiness is something I can buy.
  But the more I spend, the less I feel,
  This capitalist dream ain't fucking real.

  Nine to five grind, then overtime,
  Chasing that dollar, losing our prime.
  Boss got us locked, like we doing time,
  But life's slipping by, ain't that a crime?
  Fuck your deadlines, I'm living free,
  No more shackles, it's time to be me.
  The cake is a lie, a corporate scheme,
  Living for me, not their machine.

  They sell rebellion, but it's all a trick,
  Distract us with gadgets, make us sick.
  Drawn to the screen, like bugs to the light,
  Trapped in the glare, losing our mind.
  Fuck your system, fuck your lies,
  We're breaking free, we're cutting ties.
  No more running, no more games,
  We're taking back our fucking names
