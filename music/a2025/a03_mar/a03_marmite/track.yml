  This track is dedicated to our cat, Marmite, she's super cute and fluffy. She's usually chill but sometimes she gets scared and hisses (not because she's angry, definitely not!) :D

  Audio generated by www.udio.com and the cover is a real life photo of Marmite (she is like one year old here, but now she is like eight y/o)!

  Udio prompt:

  Used combinations of these tags at different stages: microtonal, phonk, djent, 2020s, juke, playful, melodic, uplifting, positive, metal, hindi, hindustani classical music, aggressive, footwork

  Udio credits used: like a ton of credits, more than 3K, likely around 5K. Spent a couple of months on this track but I'm happy with the results.
