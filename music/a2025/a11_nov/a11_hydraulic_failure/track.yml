  Suno credits used: about 2500.

  Used combination of the following Suno prompts:

  1. An underground electronic track rooted in experimental / introspective aesthetic of 2020s, with microtonal bass, unconventional percussion and harmonies and melodies, sounding novel and experimental,  unconventional harmonies, non-repetitive and non-mainstream, the harmonies are unusual, sometimes dissonant and lush, drawing inspiration for phonk, abstract club and footwork but with unusual and surprising elements and mixture of genres.

  2. An underground electronic track rooted in k-pop, djent and abstract club, with unusual and surprising elements and mixture of genres, changes of harmonies tempo and mood, microtonal bass, nonrepetitive, song evolves into different one with unconventional percussion and harmonies and melodies.

  3. The track continues for six minutes and is filled with playful and lush k-pop vocal layers. Rhythmic structures warp often, moving from frenetic polyrhythms to minimal abstract club beats. Harmonic shifts are abrupt, with modulating synth textures and unpredictable melodies. The song mutates midway, introducing irregular percussion, with harmonies becoming increasingly dissonant and kaleidoscopic. No section repeats, producing a constantly evolving sonic journey, each section is new.
